// COMPREHENSIVE BATCH MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
// This is a major system redesign for proper pharmaceutical inventory

🏥 PHARMACEUTICAL BATCH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
==========================================

📋 CURRENT PROBLEMS:
❌ Single batch per medication (PAR-1010 → 1244 units)
❌ Adding stock overwrites batch info
❌ No FIFO tracking
❌ Cannot handle multiple expiry dates
❌ Risk of dispensing expired medication

🎯 PROPOSED SOLUTION: SEPARATE BATCH TRACKING

📊 NEW DATABASE STRUCTURE:
==========================

1. MEDICATIONS TABLE (Modified):
   - Remove: batchNumber, unitsInStock, expiryDate
   - Add: totalStock (calculated), nextExpiryDate (calculated)
   
2. MEDICATION_BATCHES TABLE (New):
   - id (Primary Key)
   - medicationId (Foreign Key)
   - batchNumber (e.g., "PAR-1010", "PAR-1011")
   - quantityReceived (original amount)
   - quantityRemaining (current amount)
   - unitCost
   - expiryDate
   - receivedDate
   - supplier
   - status (active/expired/recalled)

📝 EXAMPLE DATA STRUCTURE:
=========================

Paracetamol (ID: 1):
├── Total Stock: 1244 (calculated)
├── Next Expiry: 2025-10-08 (earliest)
└── Batches:
    ├── Batch PAR-1010 (Exp: 2027-11-11) - 800 units
    ├── Batch PAR-1015 (Exp: 2025-10-08) - 200 units ⚠️  EXPIRES SOON
    └── Batch PAR-1020 (Exp: 2028-03-15) - 244 units

🔄 IMPLEMENTATION PHASES:
========================

PHASE 1: Database Migration
- Create medication_batches table
- Migrate existing data to batch records
- Update Medication model
- Create associations

PHASE 2: Backend API Updates
- Update inventory endpoints
- Implement FIFO logic
- Add batch management endpoints
- Update add-stock functionality

PHASE 3: Frontend Updates
- Modify inventory displays
- Update add-stock modal
- Add batch detail views
- Implement expiry warnings

PHASE 4: Advanced Features
- Automatic FIFO dispensing
- Batch recall functionality
- Advanced reporting
- Audit trails

⚠️  MIGRATION COMPLEXITY:
========================

HIGH IMPACT AREAS:
1. Database Schema Changes
2. Existing Data Migration
3. API Endpoint Updates
4. Frontend Component Updates
5. Add Stock Functionality
6. Dispensing Logic
7. Reporting Systems

ESTIMATED EFFORT:
- Database: 2-3 hours
- Backend: 4-6 hours  
- Frontend: 6-8 hours
- Testing: 2-3 hours
Total: 14-20 hours

🚨 RISKS:
=========
- Data loss during migration
- Downtime during deployment
- User training required
- Potential bugs in new logic

💡 ALTERNATIVE: QUICK FIX APPROACH
=================================

If full batch system is too complex, we could:
1. Keep current structure
2. Add "batchHistory" JSON field
3. Track multiple batches in single record
4. Less optimal but faster to implement

DECISION NEEDED:
===============
🔴 Full Batch System (Recommended but complex)
🟡 Quick Fix Approach (Faster but limited)
🟢 Keep Current System (No changes needed)
