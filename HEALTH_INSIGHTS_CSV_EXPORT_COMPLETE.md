## Implementation

### File Modified
**File**: `src/components/management/components/HealthcareInsights.js`

### New Function: `exportToCSV(chartType)`
```javascript
const exportToCSV = (chartType) => {
  // Creates CSV content based on chart type
  // Generates filename with timestamp
  // Downloads file automatically to browser
}
```

**Location**: Added after `handleGroupModeChange` function (around line 189)

- Filename-safe (no `/` or `:` characters)
- Clearly shows date and time of export
- Prevents filename conflicts for multiple exports

### CSV Format Standards
- **Delimiter**: Comma (`,`)
- **Text Qualifier**: Double quotes (`"`) for fields containing commas
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 with BOM
- **Line Endings**: CRLF (`\r\n`)
- **Header Row**: Always included

### Browser Compatibility
