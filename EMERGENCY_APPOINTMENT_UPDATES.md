# Emergency Appointment Feature - Updates & Fixes

## Update Date
October 11, 2025

## Changes Made

### ✅ 1. Emergency Button Repositioned
**Previous:** Emergency button was beside "Book Appointment" button in main header
**Current:** Emergency button is now **inside** the booking modal header

**Rationale:**
- Prevents accidental emergency bookings
- Users must first open the booking modal
- Forces deliberate action to request emergency consultation
- Closes booking modal automatically when emergency flow starts

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/patient/components/PatientAppointments.js`
  - Removed emergency button from `header-actions` div
  - Added emergency button to `modal-header` inside booking modal
  - Button now appears next to "Book New Appointment" title
  - Automatically closes booking modal when clicked

- `src/components/patient/styles/PatientAppointments.css`
  - Added new class: `.emergency-apt-trigger-btn-modal`
  - Smaller size (13px font, 8px/16px padding) to fit in modal header
  - Same red gradient styling and animations
  - Pulsing warning icon

### ✅ 2. X Button Removed from Booking Modal
**Previous:** Booking modal had an X button in the top-right corner
**Current:** X button removed - users must use Cancel or Book Appointment buttons

**Rationale:**
- Prevents accidental modal closure
- Forces users to make conscious decision (Cancel vs Book)
- Consistent with emergency modal design (no X buttons)
- Improves data integrity (no half-filled forms abandoned accidentally)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/patient/components/PatientAppointments.js`
  - Removed `close-btn` button with X icon from `modal-header`
  - Replaced with emergency button
  - Users can still close by:
    - Clicking outside modal (backdrop)
    - Clicking "Cancel" button at bottom

### ✅ 3. Senior Citizens (60+) Booking Privilege
**Previous:** All patients had 2-day advance booking requirement
**Current:** Patients aged 60+ can book appointments anytime (same day or future)

**Features:**
- **Age Check:** Uses `user?.age` field to determine eligibility
- **Same-day Booking:** Seniors can book appointments starting today
- **Weekend Restriction Still Applies:** Weekends remain unavailable for everyone
- **Emergency Limits Still Apply:** 60+ patients still have 2-per-month emergency limit

**Implementation Details:**

#### Modified Functions:

**`getMinBookableDate()`**
```javascript
// Before: Always returned today + 2 days
// After: 
- Seniors (60+): Returns today (skipping weekends)
- Regular patients: Returns today + 2 days (skipping weekends)
```

**`isValidBookingDate(date)`**
```javascript
// Before: date >= today + 2 days && !weekend
// After:
- Seniors (60+): date >= today && !weekend
- Regular patients: date >= today + 2 days && !weekend
```

**Logic:**
```javascript
const isSenior = user?.age && parseInt(user.age) >= 60;

if (isSenior) {
  // Can book today or any future day (excluding weekends)
  return daysDiff >= 0 && !isWeekend(date);
} else {
  // Must book at least 2 days ahead (excluding weekends)
  return daysDiff >= 2 && !isWeekend(date);
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/patient/components/PatientAppointments.js`
  - Updated `getMinBookableDate()` function
  - Updated `isValidBookingDate()` function
  - Both functions now check patient age
  - Added senior citizen bypass logic

- Users must consciously choose Cancel or Book
- Reduces incomplete/abandoned bookings

### 3. Better Senior Citizen Access
- Seniors (60+) have flexible same-day booking
- Recognizes increased healthcare needs of elderly

## Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, you can revert changes:

### Revert Emergency Button Location
1. Remove `.emergency-apt-trigger-btn-modal` from modal header
2. Add `.close-btn` back to modal header
3. Add `.emergency-apt-trigger-btn` back to main header actions

### Revert Senior Citizen Bypass
1. Remove `isSenior` check from `getMinBookableDate()`
2. Remove `isSenior` check from `isValidBookingDate()`
3. Restore original logic: `daysDiff >= 2 && !isWeekend(date)`

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Age Data Dependency:** Requires `user.age` to be populated. If age is null/undefined, falls back to regular patient rules (2-day advance).

2. **Static Age Check:** Age is checked at booking time only. Birthday during booking period not dynamically updated.

3. **Emergency Limits Apply to All:** Even 60+ patients have emergency usage limits (2 per month, 14-day cooldown).

4. **Weekend Restriction Universal:** All patients (including 60+) cannot book on weekends for regular appointments.

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Age Verification:** Add visual indicator in modal showing "Senior Citizen Privilege Active"
2. **Dynamic Age Calculation:** Calculate age from birthdate instead of static age field
3. **Flexible Weekend Booking:** Allow emergency appointments on weekends for all ages
4. **Senior Emergency Limits:** Consider relaxing emergency limits for 60+ patients
5. **Analytics:** Track usage patterns of senior same-day bookings
