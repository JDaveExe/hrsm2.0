```

mysql -u root -p hrsm2

-- Check recent audit logs
SELECT 
    id,
    userName,

    actionDescription,
    timestamp
FROM audit_logs
WHERE action = 'removed_patient'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 5;

| id   | userName  | action          | actionDescription                | timestamp           |
+------+-----------+-----------------+----------------------------------+---------------------+
| 1234 | Admin     | removed_patient | Admin removed patient John Doe   | 2025-10-06 14:30:00 |
+------+-----------+-----------------+----------------------------------+---------------------+
```

## Troubleshooting

### Button stays "Delete" (no cooldown)
**Problem:** Cooldown not triggering  
**Check:** Look for errors in browser console

### No audit log appears
**Problem:** Backend not logging  
**Check:** Backend console for errors during deletion

### Patient not deleted
**Problem:** API error  
**Check:** Network tab in DevTools (F12)

## Quick Commands

```powershell
# View backend logs
cd backend
node server.js

# View frontend errors
# Open browser console (F12)
# Check Console tab

# Database check
mysql -u root -p hrsm2
SELECT * FROM audit_logs WHERE action='removed_patient' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;
```
