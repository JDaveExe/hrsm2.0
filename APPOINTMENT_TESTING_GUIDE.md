# Appointment System Testing Guide

## 🧪 Test Scenarios Implemented

### 1. **Exact Time Conflict Test**
- **Scenario**: Patient A books appointment at specific date/time, then Patient B tries to book same date/time with different service type
- **Expected Result**: System should reject the second booking with error message
- **Implementation**: Backend now checks for exact date+time conflicts regardless of service type

### 2. **Daily Appointment Limit Test**  
- **Scenario**: System limits appointments to 12 per day maximum
- **Expected Result**: After 12 appointments booked for a day, 13th booking should be rejected
- **Implementation**: 
  - Backend validates daily count before allowing new appointments
  - Frontend checks daily limits and disables booking when full
  - Clear UI messages inform users when dates are fully booked

### 3. **30-Minute Buffer Validation**
- **Scenario**: Appointments within 30 minutes should be rejected to prevent overlaps
- **Expected Result**: If appointment exists at 14:00, booking at 14:15 should be rejected, but 14:30 should be allowed
- **Implementation**: Backend maintains 30-minute buffer between appointments

## 🚀 Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Backend server running on `http://localhost:5000`
2. MySQL database connected and accessible
3. Node.js with `axios` package available

### Quick Test Run
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd C:\Users\dolfo\hrsm2.0

# Run the comprehensive test suite
node run-appointment-tests.js
```

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Test Exact Time Conflicts**:
   - Login as admin
   - Create two test patients
   - Book appointment for Patient 1 at specific date/time
   - Try to book appointment for Patient 2 at same date/time but different service
   - Should be rejected with "This exact time slot is already booked" message

2. **Test Daily Limits**:
   - Book 12 appointments for the same date
   - Try to book 13th appointment
   - Should be rejected with "Daily appointment limit reached" message
   - Frontend should show "Date Fully Booked" message and disable booking button

3. **Test UI Feedback**:
   - Select a date with 12+ appointments in patient dashboard
   - Verify booking button shows "Date Fully Booked" and is disabled
   - Verify orange warning message appears explaining the limit

## 🔧 System Validation Rules

### Backend Validation (routes/appointments.js)
- ✅ **Daily Limit**: Maximum 12 appointments per day
- ✅ **Exact Time Conflict**: No two appointments at same date+time
- ✅ **Buffer Time**: 30-minute minimum gap between appointments  
- ✅ **Patient Active Limit**: 1 active appointment per patient maximum
- ✅ **Cancellation Cooldown**: 24-hour wait after cancellation
- ✅ **Weekend Restriction**: No appointments on Saturdays/Sundays

### Frontend Validation (PatientAppointments.js)
- ✅ **Daily Limit Check**: Automatically checks when date selected
- ✅ **UI Feedback**: Clear messages when limits reached
- ✅ **Button States**: Disabled booking when constraints violated
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Specific messages for different error types

### Error Codes
- `DAILY_LIMIT_REACHED`: 12 appointments already booked for date
- `EXACT_TIME_CONFLICT`: Another appointment exists at exact same time
- `BUFFER_TIME_CONFLICT`: Appointment too close (within 30 minutes)

## 📊 Expected Test Results

### ✅ PASS Criteria
- **Scenario 1**: Second patient booking rejected with clear error message
- **Scenario 2**: 13th appointment rejected after 12 successful bookings
- **Scenario 3**: Buffer time validation working (reject <30min, allow ≥30min)

### ❌ FAIL Criteria  
- Multiple appointments allowed at same exact time
- More than 12 appointments allowed per day
- No UI feedback when limits reached
- Generic error messages instead of specific validation errors

## 🎯 Test Coverage Summary

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

If tests fail:
1. Check backend server is running and database connected
2. Verify admin authentication works (check login credentials)
3. Check console logs for detailed error messages
4. Ensure test data cleanup completes successfully
5. Verify appointment model has required fields (status, isActive, etc.)
