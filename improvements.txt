admin dashboard:
- on todays checkup > doctor's queue view remove the remove patients button.
- enhance the tracking of available doctors, it has some bugs still like it does not track the doctor is online(logged in without any patients on its checkup, or just finished a checkup), busy(logged in, with patients on checkup), and offline(not logged in). It is also inaccurate on tracking. 
- on patient database > family records (there is a table with family head (optional)) > view members, add a button beside the close named 'edit family head', it is to allow the user to change the family head whenever needed, and should be updated/saved.
