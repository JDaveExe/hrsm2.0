# Patient Visits by Street - Fixed to Include Vaccinations âœ…

## Issue Identified
The "Patient Visits by Street" graph in the Management Dashboard was only counting **completed checkups**, not vaccinations. This was inconsistent with the Admin Dashboard's "Patient Checkup Trends" which counts BOTH checkups AND vaccinations.

---

## Solution Applied

### 1. Backend API Update âœ…
**File**: `backend/routes/checkups.js` (lines 1677-1745)

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/checkups/analytics/purok-visits`

**Previous Logic**:
```javascript
// Only counted check_in_sessions with status='completed'
const checkInSessions = await CheckInSession.findAll({
  where: { status: 'completed' },
  include: [{ model: Patient, ... }]
});
```

**New Logic** (matches Admin Dashboard pattern):
```sql
SELECT 
  p.purok,
  p.street,
  COUNT(*) as visits
FROM (
  -- Completed checkups
  SELECT DISTINCT
    cis.id as visitId,
    cis.patientId,
    'checkup' as visitType
  FROM check_in_sessions cis
  WHERE cis.status = 'completed'
  
  UNION ALL
  
  -- Administered vaccinations
  SELECT DISTINCT
    v.id as visitId,
    v.patientId,
    'vaccination' as visitType
  FROM vaccinations v
  WHERE v.administeredAt IS NOT NULL
) as combined_visits
INNER JOIN patients p ON combined_visits.patientId = p.id
WHERE p.purok IS NOT NULL 
  AND p.purok != ''
  AND p.street IS NOT NULL 
  AND p.street != ''
GROUP BY p.purok, p.street
ORDER BY p.purok, visits DESC
```

**Key Changes**:
- Uses raw SQL with `UNION ALL` to combine both data sources
- Counts each completed checkup as a visit
- Counts each administered vaccination as a visit
- Groups by `purok` and `street`
- Filters out empty/null purok and street values
- Returns proper visit counts per street

---

### 2. Frontend Update âœ…
**File**: `src/components/management/components/HealthcareInsights.js`

**Change**: Removed sample data fallback for purok streets

**Previous**:
```javascript
// Sample data for purok streets (not used when API is available)
setPurokStreetsData([
  { purok: 'Purok 1', street: 'Bernardo St.', visits: 50 },
  { purok: 'Purok 1', street: 'Harrison Bend', visits: 45 },
  ...
]);
```

**New**:
```javascript
// DO NOT use sample data for purok streets - let it remain empty if no real data
// The graph will show "No data available" which is correct for a fresh system
```

**Benefit**: Ensures the graph ONLY shows real data from the database, never fake sample data.

---

## Data Flow

```
Database
â”œâ”€â”€ check_in_sessions (status='completed')
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Patient visit via checkup
â””â”€â”€ vaccinations (administeredAt IS NOT NULL)
    â””â”€â”€ Patient visit via vaccination
           â†“
    UNION ALL combines both
           â†“
    Join with patients table for purok + street
           â†“
    GROUP BY purok, street
           â†“
    COUNT(*) = total visits per street
           â†“
    Backend returns {streetData, purokSummary}
           â†“
    Frontend displays color-coded bars by Purok
```

## Testing Checklist

### Data Accuracy
- [ ] Register a patient with Purok and Street
- [ ] Complete a checkup for that patient
- [ ] Verify visit appears in "Patient Visits by Street" graph
- [ ] Administer a vaccination to same patient
- [ ] Verify visit count increases by 1
- [ ] Check that both checkup and vaccination are counted

### Graph Functionality
- [ ] Graph shows real data only (no sample fallback)
- [ ] Empty state shows "No data available" when no visits exist
- [ ] Purok filter works correctly
- [ ] Visit counts are accurate for each street
- [ ] Purok summary totals match sum of streets

### Consistency Check
- [ ] Admin Dashboard "Checkup Trends" counts match logic
- [ ] Management Dashboard "Patient Visits by Street" uses same counting method
- [ ] Both count checkups AND vaccinations

---

## Database Requirements

**Required Tables**:
1. **check_in_sessions**
   - Must have `status` column (value: 'completed')
   - Must have `patientId` foreign key

2. **vaccinations**
   - Must have `administeredAt` column (non-null for completed vaccinations)
   - Must have `patientId` foreign key

3. **patients**
   - Must have `purok` column (e.g., 'Purok 1', 'Purok 2', etc.)
   - Must have `street` column (e.g., 'Bernardo St.', 'Blue St.', etc.)

---

## Expected Behavior

### Scenario 1: Patient completes checkup
- Patient: John Doe
- Address: Purok 1, Bernardo St.
- Action: Doctor completes checkup
- Result: "Bernardo St." under Purok 1 shows +1 visit

### Scenario 2: Patient receives vaccination
- Patient: Jane Smith  
- Address: Purok 2, Blue St.
- Action: Nurse administers vaccine
- Result: "Blue St." under Purok 2 shows +1 visit

### Scenario 3: Patient has both checkup AND vaccination
- Patient: Bob Johnson
- Address: Purok 3, C. Santos St.
- Actions:
  1. Completes checkup â†’ C. Santos St. shows 1 visit
  2. Receives vaccination â†’ C. Santos St. shows 2 visits
- Result: Each interaction counts as a separate visit

---

## Consistency with Admin Dashboard

Both dashboards now use the **exact same logic**:

### Admin Dashboard - Checkup Trends
```sql
-- Combines checkups and vaccinations with UNION ALL
SELECT DATE(updatedAt) as date, COUNT(*) as completedCheckups
FROM check_in_sessions 
WHERE status = 'completed'
GROUP BY DATE(updatedAt)

UNION ALL

SELECT DATE(administeredAt) as date, COUNT(*) as completedCheckups
FROM vaccinations 
GROUP BY DATE(administeredAt)
```

### Management Dashboard - Patient Visits by Street
```sql
-- Same UNION ALL approach, grouped by purok/street instead of date
SELECT p.purok, p.street, COUNT(*) as visits
FROM (
  SELECT patientId FROM check_in_sessions WHERE status='completed'
  UNION ALL
  SELECT patientId FROM vaccinations WHERE administeredAt IS NOT NULL
) combined
JOIN patients p ON combined.patientId = p.id
GROUP BY p.purok, p.street
```

**Result**: Both dashboards now provide consistent analytics! ðŸŽ‰

## Files Modified

### Backend
- âœ… `backend/routes/checkups.js` (lines 1677-1745)
  - Replaced Sequelize ORM query with raw SQL
  - Added UNION ALL to combine checkups and vaccinations
  - Added proper filtering for non-null purok/street

### Frontend  
- âœ… `src/components/management/components/HealthcareInsights.js` (lines 120-180)
  - Removed sample data fallback for purok streets
  - Ensures only real database data is displayed

---

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Analytics**: Counts ALL patient interactions (checkups + vaccinations)
2. **Dashboard Consistency**: Management and Admin dashboards use same counting logic
3. **No Fake Data**: Removed sample data fallback to show true system state
4. **Better Insights**: Healthcare managers see complete picture of patient engagement
5. **Proper Filtering**: Only shows streets with valid purok/street data

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Data**:
   - Register patients with new Purok/Street address format
   - Complete checkups and administer vaccinations
   - Verify counts are accurate

2. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Check query performance with large datasets
   - Consider adding indexes on `patientId`, `purok`, `street` if slow

3. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Add date range filter to see visits over specific time period
   - Show breakdown of checkups vs vaccinations per street
   - Export detailed visit report
