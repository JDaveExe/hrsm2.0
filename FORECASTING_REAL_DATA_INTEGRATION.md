## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Database Queries
**Disease Pattern Recognition:**
```sql
-- Maps appointment types, symptoms, and diagnoses to disease categories
-- Tracks dengue, diarrheal, respiratory, and leptospirosis cases
-- Combines Appointments and check_in_sessions data
```

**Resource Usage Tracking:**
```sql
-- Medications: Prescription data from check_in_sessions
-- Vaccines: Real vaccination records from Vaccinations table
-- Supplies: Estimated from appointment volume and visit types
-- Emergency: High-priority appointments and emergency cases
```

### Disease Mapping Intelligence
- **Dengue**: Fever, hemorrhagic symptoms, platelet issues
- **Diarrheal**: Gastroenteritis, stomach issues, dehydration
- **Respiratory**: Cough, pneumonia, breathing difficulties
- **Leptospirosis**: Flood-related, kidney problems, jaundice

### Risk Assessment Algorithm
```
Risk Score = Trend Points + Seasonal Points + Disease Virulence Points

Thresholds:
- Low Risk: 0 points
- Medium Risk: 1-2 points  
- High Risk: 3-4 points
- Critical Risk: 5+ points
```
