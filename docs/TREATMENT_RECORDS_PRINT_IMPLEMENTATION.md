# ✅ Treatment Records Print Function - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Redesigned the treatment records printing functionality to print individual records with a compact government header, moving from screenshot-like printing to professional formatted documents.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Screenshot-Like Printing
**Before:** Printing would capture the entire modal with multiple records
**After:** Each record has its own print button for individual printing

### 2. No Government Header
**Before:** Plain modal screenshot without official branding
**After:** Professional government header on every printed record

### 3. Print Button Location
**Before:** Single "Print Records" button in footer (printed all records)
**After:** Individual "Print" button in each record header (prints one record)

## Implementation Details

### A. Compact Government Header

**Design Specifications:**
```css
/* Header Container */
.government-header {
  padding: 12px 0;           /* Smaller than Clinical Notes */
  border-bottom: 2px solid #28a745;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

/* Seals */
.government-seal, .barangay-seal {
  width: 50px;               /* Smaller: 60px → 50px */
  height: 50px;
}

/* Text Styling */
.government-title {
  font-size: 18px;           /* Compact: 22px → 18px */
  margin: 0 0 2px 0;
}

.government-subtitle {
  font-size: 14px;           /* Smaller: 16px → 14px */
  margin: 0 0 2px 0;
}

.government-tagline {
  font-size: 9px;            /* Tiny: 10px → 9px */

```
