## 📂 Files Modified

### 1. `src/services/adminService.js`
- **Added:** `deletePatient(patientId)` method
- **Purpose:** Calls backend DELETE /api/patients/:id
- **Lines:** ~505-516, 561

### 2. `src/components/admin/components/PatientManagement.js`
- **Added:** `deleteCooldown` state (line 67)
- **Added:** Cooldown timer useEffect (lines 115-121)
- **Modified:** Delete confirmation handler (lines 2398-2450)
- **Modified:** Delete button with cooldown UI (lines 2356, 2455-2457)

### 3. Backend (No Changes Needed - Already Working!)
- `backend/routes/patients.js` - DELETE endpoint exists
- `backend/utils/auditLogger.js` - Audit logging already configured
- `src/components/admin/components/AuditTrail.js` - Display already configured

## 🔄 How It Works

### User Flow
```
Admin Dashboard
    ↓
Patient Database
    ↓
Click Patient → View Info
    ↓
Click "Manage" Dropdown
    ↓
Click "Delete Patient" (red button)
    ↓
Confirmation Modal Appears
    ↓
Click "Delete" Button
    ↓
Button Changes to "Wait 10s"
    ↓
Patient Deleted + Audit Log Created
    ↓
Success Message Shown
    ↓
Patient List Refreshed
    ↓
Countdown: 9s, 8s, 7s... 1s
    ↓
Button Re-enabled After 10 Seconds
```

### Technical Flow
```javascript
// 1. User clicks Delete
handleDeletePatient() → setConfirmAction('delete')

// 2. User confirms in modal
onClick handler checks auth → calls adminService.deletePatient()

// 3. Backend processes
DELETE /api/patients/:id → AuditLogger.logPatientRemoval() → patient.destroy()

// 4. Frontend updates
setDeleteCooldown(10) → refresh data → close modals → show success

// 5. Cooldown timer
useEffect monitors deleteCooldown → decrements every second → re-enables button at 0
```

  "targetId": 123,
  "targetName": "John Doe",

}
```
