# ✅ Password Change Auto-Logout Feature - Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Component:** `src/components/patient/components/PatientProfile.js`  
**Feature:** Auto-logout after password change (Patient Dashboard only)

---

## 🎯 Requirements

✅ **Only applies to password changes** - Not other profile updates  
✅ **Only for patients** - Not for admin editing patient profiles  
✅ **Shows confirmation message** - Clear prompt that logout is happening  
✅ **5-second countdown** - Visual countdown timer before auto-logout  
✅ **Manual logout option** - "Logout Now" button to skip countdown

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### 1. Added State Management

```javascript
// Auto-logout after password change state
const [showLogoutCountdown, setShowLogoutCountdown] = useState(false);
const [logoutCountdown, setLogoutCountdown] = useState(5);
```

### 2. Added useAuth Hook

```javascript
import { useAuth } from '../../../context/AuthContext';
const { logout } = useAuth();
```

### 3. Modified `handleSaveChanges()` Function

- Tracks if password is being changed: `const passwordIsBeingChanged = isChangingPassword`
- After successful save, if password was changed:
  - Shows logout countdown modal
  - Resets countdown to 5 seconds
- If only profile data changed (no password):
  - Shows regular success alert

### 4. Added Countdown Timer useEffect

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (showLogoutCountdown && logoutCountdown > 0) {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setLogoutCountdown(prev => prev - 1);
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  } else if (showLogoutCountdown && logoutCountdown === 0) {
    // Time's up, logout the user
    logout();
  }
}, [showLogoutCountdown, logoutCountdown, logout]);
```

### 5. Added Countdown Modal UI

- Full-screen overlay (z-index: 9999)
- Centered modal with clean design
- Green success header with check icon
- Large countdown number (3rem font size)
- Informative message about re-login
- "Logout Now" button for immediate logout
- Responsive and accessible

---

## 🎨 Modal Design

### Visual Elements:
- ✅ **Green success border** - Indicates successful password change
- ✅ **Large countdown timer** - Shows remaining seconds (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
- ✅ **Clear message** - "You will be logged out automatically. You need to login again using your new password."
- ✅ **Info box** - Shows countdown in text format
- ✅ **Logout Now button** - Blue primary button for manual logout

### User Experience:
1. User changes password in "My Profile"
2. Clicks "Save Changes"
3. Password validation passes
4. Profile updates successfully
5. **Modal appears immediately** with "5" showing
6. Countdown decreases every second: 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1
7. At 0, user is automatically logged out
8. Redirected to login page
9. Must use new password to login
