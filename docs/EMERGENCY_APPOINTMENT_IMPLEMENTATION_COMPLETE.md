---

## CSS Naming Convention

- `emergency-apt-banner-*` - Admin banner styles

- `emergency-apt-table-*` - Table-specific styles

---

## API Error Codes

### Emergency-Specific Errors

### General Errors
- `DAILY_LIMIT_REACHED` - 12 appointments per day
- `EXACT_TIME_CONFLICT` - Time slot unavailable
- `BUFFER_TIME_CONFLICT` - Time too close to another appointment

---

## Security & Abuse Prevention

### Implemented Measures
1. **Usage Limits** - 2 per 30 days, enforced server-side
2. **Cooldown Period** - 14 days between emergencies
3. **Required Reason** - Minimum 20 characters description
4. **Category Selection** - Must choose from predefined list
5. **Admin Notification** - Immediate alert to administrators
6. **Audit Trail** - All emergency appointments logged
7. **No Retroactive Changes** - Cannot change regular to emergency

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Doctor validation: Mark if emergency was legitimate
- Penalty system: Block feature if misused repeatedly
- SMS/Email alerts to admin team
- Emergency appointment analytics dashboard

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
1. **Database Index** - `idx_appointments_emergency` on isEmergency field
2. **Efficient Queries** - Date range filtering in SQL
3. **Client-side Caching** - Emergency usage data cached briefly
4. **Polling Interval** - 30 seconds (not real-time) reduces server load
5. **localStorage** - Dismissed banners stored locally

### Monitoring Recommendations
- Track emergency appointment frequency
- Monitor API response times for `/emergency-usage` endpoint
- Alert if emergency rate exceeds threshold (e.g., >20% of all appointments)

---
