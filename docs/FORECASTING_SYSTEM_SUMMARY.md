### 2. **Resource Forecasting**
- Predicts daily/monthly needs for:
  - Medications
  - Medical supplies
  - Vaccines
  - Emergency resources
- **Seasonal adjustments**: 50-100% supply increases during typhoon season
- Confidence intervals and uncertainty ranges

### 3. **Interactive Dashboard**

## 🔧 How It Works

### Data Sources
**Real Database Integration:**
- Patient appointment records → Disease pattern detection
- Check-in sessions → Symptom tracking
- Prescriptions → Medication usage
- Vaccination records → Vaccine demand
- Appointment types → Resource allocation

### Forecasting Algorithms

**1. Disease Risk Scoring (Multi-Factor)**
```
Risk Score = Trend Points + Seasonal Points + Disease Virulence

Points System:
- Low Risk: 0 points
- Medium Risk: 1-2 points
- High Risk: 3-4 points
- Critical: 5+ points
```

**Factors Considered:**
- **Trend Analysis**: 7-day moving average of cases
- **Seasonal Risk**: Typhoon season = higher risk
- **Disease Virulence**: Dengue = high, Diarrheal = medium
- **Percentage Change**: Week-over-week case increases

**2. Resource Forecasting (Exponential Smoothing)**
```
Forecast = α × Current Usage + (1-α) × Previous Forecast
Then multiply by seasonal adjustment (1.5× for typhoon season)
```

**3. Seasonal Pattern Recognition**
- **Wet Season** (June-November): High risk period
- **Dry Season** (December-May): Lower risk period
- Geographic Context: Philippines epidemiological patterns

## 🌊 Philippines-Specific Intelligence

### Typhoon Season Detection
- **Period**: June to November
- **Risk Multiplier**: 1.5× to 2.0×
- **Disease Correlation**: Flood-related illnesses spike

### Common Disease Patterns
- **Dengue**: Peaks during rainy season, mosquito-borne
- **Diarrheal**: Increases with floods, contaminated water
- **Respiratory**: Wet season complications, cold weather
- **Leptospirosis**: Flood-related, rodent exposure

### Resource Planning Adjustments
- **Emergency Preparedness**: Enhanced during typhoon months
- **Supply Chain**: Accounts for delivery delays during storms
- **Stock Buffers**: 50-100% increases recommended
