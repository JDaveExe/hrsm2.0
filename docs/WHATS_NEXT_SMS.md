   - Open: `TWILIO_SMS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
   - Comprehensive step-by-step instructions
   - Covers everything from account creation to testing

2. **Quick Start** (If you're in a hurry)
   - Open: `QUICK_START_SMS.md`
   - 5-minute setup guide

### Option 2: Keep Testing with Mock Mode

**To enable mock mode:**
```env
# In backend\.env
ENABLE_SMS_MOCK=true
