# 🐛 Checkup Trends "Years" View Bug Fix

**Issue Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🔍 Problem Description

### User-Reported Issue:
When selecting the "Years" view in the Patient Checkup Trends chart on the Admin Dashboard:
1. The view flashes to "Years" for a split second
2. Immediately reverts back to "Week" view
3. Console shows `500 Internal Server Error` from `/api/dashboard/checkup-trends/years`

### Root Cause:
**SQL Column Name Typo in Backend Route**

**Location**: `backend/routes/dashboard.js` - Line 900

**The Bug**:
```sql
SELECT 
  YEAR(administeredAt) as year,
  COUNT(*) as completedCheckups
FROM vaccinations 
WHERE administeredAt >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 5 YEAR)
GROUP BY YEAR(administeredDate)  ❌ WRONG COLUMN NAME!
```

**Should be**:
```sql
GROUP BY YEAR(administeredAt)  ✅ CORRECT
```

## 🔧 The Fix

### Backend Fix (dashboard.js):

**File**: `backend/routes/dashboard.js`  
**Lines**: 878-906

Changed:
```javascript
case 'years':
  // Last 5 years - Include both checkups and vaccinations
  query = `
    SELECT 
      combined.year,
      SUM(combined.completedCheckups) as completedCheckups
    FROM (
      SELECT 
        YEAR(updatedAt) as year,
        COUNT(*) as completedCheckups
      FROM check_in_sessions 
      WHERE updatedAt >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 5 YEAR)
        AND status = 'completed'
      GROUP BY YEAR(updatedAt)
      
      UNION ALL
      
      SELECT 
        YEAR(administeredAt) as year,
        COUNT(*) as completedCheckups
      FROM vaccinations 
      WHERE administeredAt >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 5 YEAR)
      GROUP BY YEAR(administeredDate)  ❌ TYPO: administeredDate
    ) as combined
    GROUP BY combined.year
    ORDER BY combined.year
  `;
  break;
```

To:
```javascript
case 'years':
  // Last 5 years - Include both checkups and vaccinations
  query = `
    SELECT 
      combined.year,
      SUM(combined.completedCheckups) as completedCheckups
    FROM (
      SELECT 
        YEAR(updatedAt) as year,
        COUNT(*) as completedCheckups
      FROM check_in_sessions 
      WHERE updatedAt >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 5 YEAR)
        AND status = 'completed'
      GROUP BY YEAR(updatedAt)
      
      UNION ALL
      
      SELECT 
        YEAR(administeredAt) as year,
        COUNT(*) as completedCheckups
      FROM vaccinations 
      WHERE administeredAt >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 5 YEAR)
      GROUP BY YEAR(administeredAt)  ✅ FIXED: administeredAt
    ) as combined
    GROUP BY combined.year
    ORDER BY combined.year
  `;
  break;
```

**Change Summary**: Changed `administeredDate` → `administeredAt` on line 900

## 🔄 How the Bug Manifested

### Frontend Flow:
1. User clicks "Years" button
2. `setCheckupTrendsPeriod('years')` is called
3. `useEffect` triggers and calls `/api/dashboard/checkup-trends/years`
4. Backend returns **500 Internal Server Error** due to SQL column name error
5. Frontend catches error and sets `checkupTrendsApiData = null`
6. `useMemo` hook detects null data and returns default "This Week" fallback
7. Chart reverts to week view automatically

### Error Message in Console:
```
🔄 Fetching checkup trends for period: years
GET http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard/checkup-trends/years 500 (Internal Server Error)
❌ Failed to fetch checkup trends for years: Internal Server Error
```

### Backend Error (Not Visible to User):
```sql
Error: Unknown column 'administeredDate' in 'group statement'
```

## 📊 Database Schema Reference

### Correct Column Names:

**check_in_sessions table**:
- ✅ `updatedAt` - When session was last updated/completed
- ✅ `checkInTime` - When patient checked in
- ✅ `createdAt` - When session was created

**vaccinations table**:
- ✅ `administeredAt` - When vaccine was administered ⭐
- ❌ `administeredDate` - **DOES NOT EXIST**
- ✅ `createdAt` - When record was created
- ✅ `updatedAt` - When record was updated

---

## ✅ Testing the Fix

### How to Verify:

1. **Start Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Open Admin Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to Admin Dashboard
   - Scroll to "Patient Checkup Trends" chart
   - Click the "Years" button

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - ✅ Chart should display data for the last 5 years
   - ✅ No console errors
   - ✅ Chart stays on "Years" view (doesn't revert)
   - ✅ Backend returns 200 OK status

4. **Check Console**:
   ```
   🔄 Fetching checkup trends for period: years
   ✅ Checkup trends data received for years: {success: true, period: 'years', data: [...]}
   ```

5. **Check Backend Logs**:
   ```
   📊 Fetching checkup trends for period: years
   ✅ Found X trend records for years
   ```

## 📝 Other Period Views (Verified Working):

### Days View:
- ✅ Uses `updatedAt` from check_in_sessions
- ✅ Uses `administeredAt` from vaccinations
- ✅ Groups by `DAYNAME(updatedAt)` and `DAYNAME(administeredAt)`

### Weeks View:
- ✅ Uses `updatedAt` from check_in_sessions
- ✅ Uses `administeredAt` from vaccinations
- ✅ Groups by `YEARWEEK(updatedAt, 1)` and `YEARWEEK(administeredAt, 1)`

### Months View:
- ✅ Uses `updatedAt` from check_in_sessions
- ✅ Uses `administeredAt` from vaccinations
- ✅ Groups by `YEAR(updatedAt), MONTH(updatedAt)` and `YEAR(administeredAt), MONTH(administeredAt)`

### Years View:
- ✅ FIXED: Now uses `administeredAt` consistently
- ✅ Groups by `YEAR(updatedAt)` and `YEAR(administeredAt)`

## 🎯 Lessons Learned

### Why This Bug Happened:
1. **Copy-Paste Error**: Likely copied from another query and forgot to update column name
2. **No Type Safety**: SQL is string-based, typos aren't caught until runtime
3. **Inconsistent Naming**: `administeredAt` vs `administeredDate` are similar

### Prevention Strategies:
1. ✅ **Code Review**: Have another developer review SQL queries
2. ✅ **Testing**: Test all view options (days, weeks, months, years) after changes
3. ✅ **Constants**: Consider using constants for column names
4. ✅ **Error Logging**: Backend error logs helped identify the exact issue

*This was a simple typo with significant UX impact. One character difference (`administeredDate` → `administeredAt`) caused the entire Years view to fail.*
