## 🎯 How Auto-Creation Works

When certain critical actions happen, notifications are **automatically created**:

### 1. Patient Deletion
```javascript
// In backend/utils/AuditLogger.js
AuditLogger.logPatientRemoval(patientId, patientName, reason, userId, userRole, userName)
  ↓
Creates audit_logs entry
  ↓
Checks if action is "removed_patient" (CRITICAL)
  ↓
Automatically creates audit_alert_notifications entry
  ↓
Frontend polls API every 10 seconds
  ↓
Banner appears with new alert!
```

### 2. User Deletion
```javascript
AuditLogger.logUserDeletion(userId, userName, userRole, performerId, performerRole, performerName)
  ↓
Auto-creates CRITICAL notification
```

### 3. User Creation
```javascript
AuditLogger.logUserCreation(newUser, performerId, performerRole, performerName)
  ↓
Auto-creates HIGH notification
```

node test-critical-banner-frontend.js
```

### To Check Database:
```bash
node check-audit-alert-table.js
```

### To Monitor API Calls:
