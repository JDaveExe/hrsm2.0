# ✅ Senior Citizen Appointment Booking Fix - Complete

## 🔍 Issue Identified
Patient aged 72 years old was still seeing the 2-day advance booking restriction despite senior citizen logic being present in the code.

### Root Cause
**The `user` object from the login API response did NOT include age information!**

The senior citizen detection logic checked for `user.age`, but:
- The Patient database model stores `dateOfBirth` (DATEONLY field), NOT age
- The login API response only returned: `id`, `username`, `email`, `role`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `accessLevel`, `patientId`
- **Missing field:** `dateOfBirth` or `age`

Result: `user?.age` was always `undefined`, so all patients (including seniors) were subject to the 2-day restriction.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Changes - Include `dateOfBirth` in Login Response

**File:** `backend/routes/auth.js`

#### Change 1: Fetch Patient's Date of Birth (Lines ~398-406)
```javascript
// For patient users, fetch the associated Patient record to get patientId and dateOfBirth
if (user.role === 'patient') {
  const patient = await Patient.findOne({
    where: { userId: user.id }
  });
  if (patient) {
    user.patientId = patient.id;
    user.dateOfBirth = patient.dateOfBirth; // Include dateOfBirth for age calculation
  }
}
```

#### Change 2: Include in Login Response (Lines ~548-561)
```javascript
res.json({ 
  token, 
  user: {
    id: user.id,
    username: user.username,
    email: user.email,
    role: user.role,
    firstName: user.firstName,
    lastName: user.lastName,
    accessLevel: user.accessLevel || ...,
    patientId: user.patientId, // Include patientId for patient users
    dateOfBirth: user.dateOfBirth // Include dateOfBirth for age calculation (patient users only)
  }
});
```

#### Change 3: Include in Registration Response (Lines ~210-222)
```javascript
res.json({ 
  token, 
  user: {
    id: user.id,
    username: user.username,
    email: user.email,
    role: user.role,
    firstName: patient.firstName,
    lastName: patient.lastName,
    patientId: patient.id,
    qrCode: patient.qrCode,
    dateOfBirth: patient.dateOfBirth // Include for age calculation
  }
});
```

### 2. Frontend Changes - Calculate Age from Date of Birth

**File:** `src/components/patient/components/PatientAppointments.js`

#### Change 1: Add Age Calculation Helper Function
```javascript
// Calculate age from date of birth
const calculateAge = (dateOfBirth) => {
  if (!dateOfBirth) return null;
  const today = new Date();
  const birthDate = new Date(dateOfBirth);
  let age = today.getFullYear() - birthDate.getFullYear();
  const monthDiff = today.getMonth() - birthDate.getMonth();
  if (monthDiff < 0 || (monthDiff === 0 && today.getDate() < birthDate.getDate())) {
    age--;
  }
  return age;
};
```

#### Change 2: Update `getMinBookableDate()` Function
```javascript
const getMinBookableDate = () => {
  const today = new Date();
  let minDate = new Date(today);
  
  // Calculate age from dateOfBirth
  const age = calculateAge(user?.dateOfBirth);
  const isSenior = age !== null && age >= 60;
  
  if (isSenior) {
    // Seniors can book starting today
    // Just skip weekends
    while (isWeekend(minDate.toISOString().split('T')[0])) {
      minDate.setDate(minDate.getDate() + 1);
    }
  } else {
    // Regular patients: Add 2 days minimum
    minDate.setDate(today.getDate() + 2);
    
    // If the minimum date falls on a weekend, move to next Monday
    while (isWeekend(minDate.toISOString().split('T')[0])) {
      minDate.setDate(minDate.getDate() + 1);
    }
  }
  
  return minDate.toISOString().split('T')[0];
};
```

#### Change 3: Update `isValidBookingDate()` Function
```javascript
const isValidBookingDate = (date) => {
  const today = new Date();
  const selectedDate = new Date(date);
  const daysDiff = Math.ceil((selectedDate - today) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  
  // Calculate age from dateOfBirth
  const age = calculateAge(user?.dateOfBirth);
  const isSenior = age !== null && age >= 60;
  
  if (isSenior) {
    // Seniors can book anytime (today or future), just not on weekends
    return daysDiff >= 0 && !isWeekend(date);
  } else {
    // Regular patients: Must be at least 2 days ahead and not a weekend
    return daysDiff >= 2 && !isWeekend(date);
  }
};
```

#### Change 4: Update Calendar Legend
```javascript
<span>Unavailable (Sundays{calculateAge(user?.dateOfBirth) >= 60 ? '' : ' & dates within 2 days'})</span>

{calculateAge(user?.dateOfBirth) >= 60 && (
  <div className="patient-appointments-legend-item">
    <i className="bi bi-star-fill patient-appointments-legend-icon text-warning"></i>
    <span>Senior Citizen: No 2-day advance booking required</span>
  </div>
)}
```

#### Change 5: Update Booking Form Error Message
```javascript
{isWeekend(bookingForm.date) 
  ? 'Appointments are not available on weekends. Please select a weekday.'
  : calculateAge(user?.dateOfBirth) >= 60
    ? 'As a senior citizen, you can book appointments for any available date. Please select a weekday.'
    : 'Appointments must be booked at least 2 days in advance. Please select a date starting from ' + new Date(getMinBookableDate()).toLocaleDateString() + '.'}
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### For Regular Patients (Age < 60)
1. User logs in → Backend returns `dateOfBirth` in response
2. Frontend calculates age: `calculateAge(user.dateOfBirth)` → e.g., 35
3. `isSenior = false` because age < 60
4. Booking restrictions apply:
   - ✅ Must book at least 2 days in advance
   - ✅ Cannot book on Saturdays or Sundays
   - ✅ Calendar shows "dates within 2 days" as unavailable

### For Senior Citizens (Age ≥ 60)
1. User logs in → Backend returns `dateOfBirth` (e.g., "1952-03-15")
2. Frontend calculates age: `calculateAge("1952-03-15")` → 72 years old
3. `isSenior = true` because age ≥ 60
4. Booking privileges:
   - ✅ Can book starting TODAY (no 2-day advance requirement)
   - ✅ Cannot book on Saturdays or Sundays (retained limit)
   - ✅ Calendar legend shows "Senior Citizen: No 2-day advance booking required"
   - ✅ Error messages customized for seniors

## 📋 Testing Steps

### Test 1: Senior Citizen Patient (72 years old)
1. **Login** as the 72-year-old patient account
2. **Navigate** to Appointments → Book Appointment
3. **Verify Calendar Legend:**
   - ❌ Should NOT show "& dates within 2 days" text
   - ✅ Should show "Senior Citizen: No 2-day advance booking required" with star icon
4. **Try to book for today (if weekday):**
   - ✅ Today's date should be clickable (green background)
   - ✅ Should be able to complete booking
5. **Try to book for tomorrow (if weekday):**
   - ✅ Tomorrow should be clickable
   - ✅ Should be able to complete booking
6. **Try to book on Saturday/Sunday:**
   - ❌ Weekend dates should show red X icon (unavailable)
   - ❌ Cannot book on weekends

### Test 2: Regular Patient (Age < 60)
1. **Login** as a regular patient account (e.g., 35 years old)
2. **Navigate** to Appointments → Book Appointment
3. **Verify Calendar Legend:**
   - ✅ Should show "Unavailable (Sundays & dates within 2 days)"
   - ❌ Should NOT show senior citizen star icon
4. **Try to book for today:**
   - ❌ Today should show red X icon (unavailable)
   - ❌ Cannot book today
5. **Try to book for 2 days from now (if weekday):**
   - ✅ Should be clickable (green background)
   - ✅ Should be able to complete booking
6. **Try to book on Saturday/Sunday:**
   - ❌ Weekend dates should show red X icon (unavailable)

### Test 3: Age Calculation Edge Cases
1. **Patient born on Feb 29 (leap year):**
   - Age calculation should handle correctly
2. **Patient with birthday today:**
   - Should use updated age (e.g., turns 60 today → senior privileges apply)
3. **Patient exactly 60 years old:**
   - Should qualify as senior citizen (age >= 60)

3. **Test with Real Patient Accounts** - Verify senior detection

### No Database Changes Required
- Patient table already has `dateOfBirth` field
- No schema migration needed
- Existing patient data works immediately

### Session Handling
- Users currently logged in will need to log out and log back in
- New login will include `dateOfBirth` in user object
- Old sessions will continue to have no age data until next login

## 📝 Technical Summary

**Problem:** Senior citizen booking privileges not working  
**Root Cause:** `user.age` was undefined (not included in login response)  
**Solution:** Return `dateOfBirth` from backend, calculate age on frontend
