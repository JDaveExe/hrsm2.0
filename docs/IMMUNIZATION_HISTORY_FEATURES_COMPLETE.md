---

## Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ PDF Export Functionality (`handleExportHistory`)

**What it does:**
- Exports complete immunization history to a professional PDF document
- Includes government seals, patient information, vaccination statistics, and detailed records table

### 2. ✅ Generate Immunization Card (`handleGenerateCard`)

**What it does:**
- Creates a printable immunization card in a new browser window
- Professional layout suitable for official health records
- Can be printed directly or saved as PDF via browser print function

**Key Features:**
- **Government Header**: 
  - Dual seal layout (government + main seal)
  - "Republic of the Philippines" official designation
  - "Barangay Health Center - Immunization Program" branding
- **Patient Information Card**:
  - Full name and Patient ID
  - Date of Birth and Current Age
  - Gender and Card Generation Date
- **Complete Vaccination Table**:
  - Chronological list of all vaccinations
  - Vaccine name (bold)
  - Date administered
  - Dose information
  - Healthcare provider
  - Brief notes
- **Signature Section**:
  - Healthcare Provider signature line
  - Date/Last Updated line
  - Professional spacing for manual signatures
- **Official Footer**:
  - "Keep this card for your records" message
  - Contact information for health center
  - Generation timestamp
- **Print Controls**:
  - "Print Card" button (auto-hidden when printing)
  - "Close" button to close preview window

**How it works:**
1. Opens new browser window with formatted HTML
2. Loads government seals from imported images
3. Displays all patient data and vaccination records in card format
4. Provides print button that triggers browser print dialog
5. Print dialog allows user to:
   - Print to physical printer
   - Save as PDF
   - Adjust print settings (margins, page size, etc.)

**Print Optimization:**
- A4 page size with optimized margins (10mm)
- Clean print output (removes print/close buttons)
- Single-page layout for standard records
- Professional typography and spacing
- Color-coded elements (blue accents)

---

### 3. ✅ Age-Based UI Adjustment

**What it does:**
- Automatically hides "Routine Childhood" category tab for patients aged 18 and older
- Shows "Routine Childhood" category only for patients aged 17 and under

**Logic:**
```javascript
const patientAge = getPatientAge(selectedPatient);
const showRoutineChildhood = patientAge <= 17; // Only show for 17 and under
```

**UI Behavior:**
- **For patients 17 and under (children/adolescents)**:
  - Shows 4 category tabs in 3-column grid layout:
    - ✅ Routine Childhood (green)
    - ✅ COVID-19 Series (blue)
    - ✅ Annual Vaccines (orange)
    - ✅ Special (gray)

- **For patients 18 and older (adults)**:
  - Shows 3 category tabs in 4-column grid layout (wider):
    - ❌ Routine Childhood (HIDDEN)
    - ✅ COVID-19 Series (blue)
    - ✅ Annual Vaccines (orange)
    - ✅ Special (gray)

**Responsive Grid:**
- Automatically adjusts column width based on number of visible tabs
- Uses Bootstrap grid: `col-md-3` (4 tabs) or `col-md-4` (3 tabs)
- Maintains consistent spacing and alignment

---

### 4. ✅ Sample Data Cleanup

**Status: Already Clean** ✓

**Verification:**
The `fetchImmunizationHistory()` function was reviewed and confirmed to be:
- ✅ Fetching from real API endpoint: `/api/vaccinations/patient/${patientId}`
- ✅ Using proper authentication headers
- ✅ NO hardcoded sample data
- ✅ Gracefully handles empty results (shows "No vaccination records found")
- ✅ Proper error handling with fallback to empty array

**Data Flow:**
1. Fetches from API: `GET /api/vaccinations/patient/{id}`
2. Transforms API response to match UI format
3. Maps fields: `vaccineName` → `vaccine`, `administeredAt` → `dateGiven`, etc.
4. Stores in state: `setImmunizationHistory(formattedHistory)`
5. Displays in table with proper formatting

**What shows in the UI:**
- The vaccination records shown in the screenshot (Influenza 2023, Tetanus-Diphtheria, COVID-19, Pneumococcal) are **REAL DATA** from your database
- These are NOT hardcoded samples - they're actual vaccination records for patient PT-0202 (Jonathan Joestar J)

**Note:** The user mentioned these are "samples" for testing purposes, meaning they're test data in the database that can be removed later, but they're not hardcoded in the frontend code.

## How Generate Card Works (Technical Explanation)

**Your Question:** "How does this work btw?"

**Answer:**

The "Generate Card" feature works by creating a **printable HTML document** that opens in a new browser window. Here's the detailed breakdown:

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **User clicks "Generate Card" button**
   - Triggers `handleGenerateCard()` function

2. **Function gathers patient data:**
   - Patient name, ID, age, gender, date of birth
   - All vaccination records from `immunizationHistory` state
   - Current date/time for generation timestamp

3. **Opens new browser window:**
   ```javascript
   const printWindow = window.open('', '_blank');
   ```
   - Creates empty window/tab
   - User sees blank page briefly

4. **Writes HTML content to window:**
   ```javascript
   printWindow.document.write(`...HTML content...`);
   ```
   - Injects complete HTML document
   - Includes CSS styles, patient data, vaccination table
   - Uses template literals to embed dynamic data

5. **Loads government seal images:**
   - Images already imported at top of file
   - `sealGovImage` and `sealMainImage` converted to base64 data URLs
   - Embedded directly in HTML (no separate image files needed)

6. **Applies professional styling:**
   - CSS included in `<style>` tag
   - Official colors (blue #0ea5e9)
   - Print-optimized layout
   - A4 page size settings
   - Responsive grid for patient info

7. **Displays vaccination records:**
   - Maps through `immunizationHistory` array
   - Creates table row for each vaccine
   - Formats dates, displays vaccine details
   - Shows "No records" message if empty

8. **Adds signature section:**
   - Blank lines for healthcare provider signature
   - Date field for last update
   - Professional spacing for manual completion

9. **Includes print controls:**
   ```javascript
   <button onclick="window.print()">Print Card</button>
   <button onclick="window.close()">Close</button>
   ```
   - Print button triggers browser print dialog
   - Close button closes the preview window
   - Buttons hidden automatically when printing (CSS: `.no-print`)

10. **Waits for images to load:**
    ```javascript
    setTimeout(() => {
      printWindow.focus();
      printWindow.print();
    }, 500);
    ```
    - 500ms delay ensures seals are loaded
    - Focuses the new window
    - Auto-triggers print dialog

### Why This Approach?

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **No external dependencies** (besides images already in project)
- ✅ **Uses native browser print** (reliable, familiar to users)
- ✅ **Cross-browser compatible** (works in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- ✅ **User has full control** (can adjust print settings, save as PDF)
- ✅ **Professional output** (high-quality print/PDF)
- ✅ **Instant preview** (user sees exactly what will print)
- ✅ **No server required** (all processing client-side)

**Comparison to Alternatives:**
- **vs. jsPDF directly:** Print method gives user more control and better quality
- **vs. Server-side PDF:** No API call needed, faster, works offline
- **vs. Screenshot libraries:** Cleaner output, better text quality, smaller file size

### Print Dialog Features:

When user clicks "Print Card", they get **browser's native print dialog** with options:
- 🖨️ **Destination:** Physical printer OR "Save as PDF"
- 📄 **Page Size:** A4, Letter, Legal, etc.
- 📐 **Margins:** Adjust spacing
- 🎨 **Color:** Color or Black & White
- 📋 **Pages:** All pages or specific range
- 🔢 **Copies:** Number of copies to print
- ⚙️ **Advanced:** Scaling, headers/footers, etc.

### Result:
- User gets official immunization card
- Can be printed on paper
- Can be saved as PDF
- Can be shared digitally
- Professional appearance suitable for official records
