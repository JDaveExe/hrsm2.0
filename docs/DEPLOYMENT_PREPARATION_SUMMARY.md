# FINAL DEBUGGING AND FIXES - DEPLOYMENT PREPARATION SUMMARY

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Project:** Health Records System Management 2.0 (HRSM 2.0)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED (4 of 5 tasks)

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. ‚úÖ Remove Instance Indicator from Homepage
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Header.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Removed the instance indicator that showed up on the top bar displaying port information (e.g., "ü©∫ DOCTOR MODE (Port 3001)")
- Cleaned up unused code for instanceMode detection
- Simplified the header component

**Result:** The instance indicator no longer appears when opening new app instances.

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Remove Test Patients from Unsorted Members
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/admin/components/PatientManagement.js`
- Created: `delete-test-patients.js` (database cleanup script)

**Changes Made:**
- Added filter in PatientManagement to exclude patients with 'test' in firstName or lastName from the unsorted members display
- Created and executed database cleanup script that:
  - Found 22 test patients in the database
  - Deleted related records (check-in sessions, appointments, vaccinations, vital signs)
  - Permanently removed all 22 test patients from the database
- Updated unsorted members count to reflect only legitimate patients

**Database Cleanup Results:**
```
‚úÖ Deleted 22 test patients
‚úÖ Deleted 0 check-in sessions
‚úÖ Deleted 0 appointments
‚úÖ Deleted 4 vaccinations
‚úÖ Deleted 8 vital signs
```

**Result:** Test patients no longer appear in unsorted members, and database is clean.

---

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Verify and Fix Appointment Status Updates
**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Reason:** This task requires deeper investigation of the workflow:
- Need to understand the complete appointment lifecycle from "check in today" through Doctor Dashboard completion
- Need to identify where duplicate appointment data exists
- Complex integration between admin appointments, check-in sessions, and doctor checkups
- Requires testing the complete flow to verify current behavior

**Recommendation:** This task should be handled separately with proper testing and workflow documentation.

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Add Audit Trail for Backup & Restore
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Files Modified:**
- `backend/utils/auditLogger.js`
- `backend/routes/backup.js`

**Changes Made:**

#### Added Two New Audit Logging Functions:
1. **`logBackupCreation(req, backupId, backupDetails)`**
   - Logs when admin creates a system backup
   - Records: backup ID, description, included components, compression level
   - Action type: `backup_created`

2. **`logBackupRestore(req, backupId, restoreDetails)`**
   - Logs when admin restores from a backup
   - Records: backup ID, restore options, overwrite settings
   - Action type: `backup_restored`
   - Marked as CRITICAL ACTION (triggers notifications)

#### Integration Points:
- Backup creation endpoint: `/api/backup/create` (POST)
- Backup restore endpoint: `/api/backup/restore/:backupId` (POST)

#### Critical Actions Updated:
Added `backup_restored` to the list of critical actions that trigger admin notifications.

**Result:** All backup and restore operations are now audited and logged. Restore operations trigger critical event notifications.

### 5. ‚úÖ Remove Performance Button from Doctor Dashboard
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/doctor/components/DoctorSidebar.js`
- `src/components/doctor/DoctorLayout.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Removed the "Performance" button from doctor dashboard sidebar footer
- Removed FPS Monitor toggle section
- Removed `showFPSMonitor` and `handleFPSToggle` props from DoctorSidebar component
- Cleaned up component prop passing in DoctorLayout

**Result:** Performance button no longer appears in doctor dashboard sidebar.
