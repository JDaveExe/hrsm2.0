### **🔬 Academic Rigor Added**

#### **Disease Risk Assessment**
```javascript
// Multi-factor Risk Scoring Formula
Risk Score = Trend Points + Seasonal Points + Disease Points

// Confidence Calculation
Confidence = 60 + (Data Points × 2) - (Standard Error × 10)

// R₀ Integration for Disease Virulence
if (R₀ > 2.0) riskScore += 1 // Highly transmissible diseases
```

#### **Resource Forecasting**
```javascript
// Enhanced Exponential Smoothing
S(t) = α × X(t) + (1-α) × S(t-1)

// Seasonal Adjustment
Forecast = Base_Forecast × Seasonal_Multiplier

// Safety Stock Calculation  
Safety Stock = Daily_Forecast × 7 days

// Confidence Intervals
CI = Forecast ± (Z_score × Standard_Error)
```

### **🎓 Q&A Preparation**

**Q: "How do you calculate disease risk?"**
**A:** Multi-factor scoring system:
1. Trend analysis (7-day moving average comparison)
2. Seasonal adjustment (typhoon season +2 points)
3. Disease virulence (R₀ reproduction number)
4. Final score determines risk level with confidence intervals

**Q: "What forecasting methods do you use?"**
**A:** 
1. Simple Moving Average (SMA) for trend detection
2. Exponential Smoothing (α=0.3) for resource planning
3. Seasonal decomposition for typhoon season adjustments
4. All with 68% and 95% confidence intervals

**Q: "How accurate are your predictions?"**
