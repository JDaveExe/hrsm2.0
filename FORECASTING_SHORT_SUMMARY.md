## ÔøΩüìä What the System Does

The forecasting system predicts **disease outbreaks** and **resource needs** for the health center by analyzing real patient data, seasonal weather patterns, and historical trends specific to the Philippines context.

---

## üéØ Types of Forecasting Used

### 1. **Disease Risk Assessment** (Multi-Factor Scoring)
**What it does:**
- Monitors 4 critical diseases: Dengue, Diarrheal, Respiratory, Leptospirosis
- Assigns risk levels: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- Generates alerts when disease cases spike

**How it works:**
```
Risk Score = Trend Points + Seasonal Points + Disease Virulence

Example for Dengue:
- 7-day case trend: +2 points (if increasing)
- Typhoon season active: +1 point (June-November)
- High virulence disease: +2 points (dengue is dangerous)
---
Total: 5 points = CRITICAL RISK
```

**Algorithm Components:**
- **Trend Analysis**: Calculates 7-day moving average of cases
  - Increasing trend = Higher risk points
  - Decreasing trend = Lower risk points
  
- **Seasonal Risk Multiplier**: 
  - Wet season (June-Nov) = Higher risk
  - Dry season (Dec-May) = Lower risk
  
- **Disease Virulence Weight**:
  - Dengue: High priority (deadly, fast-spreading)
  - Diarrheal: Medium priority (common, manageable)
  - Respiratory: Medium-high (contagious)
  - Leptospirosis: High (flood-related, severe)

- **Percentage Change Detection**:
  - Compares this week vs last week
  - >50% increase = Outbreak warning
  - >100% increase = Critical alert

---

### 2. **Resource Forecasting** (Exponential Smoothing)
**What it does:**
- Predicts daily/weekly/monthly needs for:
  - Medications (prescriptions)
  - Medical supplies (bandages, syringes, etc.)
  - Vaccines (immunization programs)
  - Emergency resources (trauma kits)

**How it works:**
```
Step 1: Calculate Base Forecast
Forecast = Œ± √ó Current Usage + (1-Œ±) √ó Previous Forecast
Where Œ± = 0.3 (smoothing factor)

Step 2: Apply Seasonal Adjustment
Final Forecast = Base Forecast √ó Seasonal Multiplier

Seasonal Multipliers:
- Typhoon Season (June-Nov): 1.5√ó (50% increase)
- Dry Season (Dec-May): 1.0√ó (normal demand)
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
Current weekly medication usage: 100 units
Previous forecast: 80 units
Smoothing factor (Œ±): 0.3

Base Forecast = 0.3 √ó 100 + 0.7 √ó 80
              = 30 + 56
              = 86 units

If it's typhoon season:
Final Forecast = 86 √ó 1.5 = 129 units

If it's dry season:
Final Forecast = 86 √ó 1.0 = 86 units
```

**Why Exponential Smoothing?**
- Gives more weight to recent usage patterns
- Smooths out random fluctuations (day-to-day variations)
- Responds to trends gradually (not too jumpy)
- Simple and reliable for healthcare resource planning

---

### 3. **Seasonal Pattern Recognition** (Philippines Climate Context)
**What it does:**
- Adjusts predictions based on Philippine weather seasons
- Accounts for typhoon season impacts

**Seasons Tracked:**
- **Wet Season / Typhoon Season** (June - November)
  - Heavy rains and flooding
  - Increased disease risk (dengue, leptospirosis, diarrheal)
  - Higher resource demand (50-100% increase)
  
- **Dry Season** (December - May)
  - Lower disease transmission
  - Normal resource usage
  - Stable healthcare demand

**Impact on Forecasts:**
```
Dengue Cases During Typhoon Season:
- Standing water ‚Üí More mosquito breeding
- Case multiplier: 2.0√ó (doubles risk)

Medication Demand During Typhoon Season:
- More patients with waterborne diseases
- Demand multiplier: 1.5√ó (50% increase)

Leptospirosis During Floods:
- Contaminated water exposure
- Case multiplier: 3.0√ó (triples risk)
```

---

## üå°Ô∏è How Seasonal Medication Demand Trends Work

### The Movement Cycle

**1. Baseline Tracking (Daily)**
```
System monitors real prescription data:
- Check-in sessions with prescriptions
- Appointment medication orders
- Historical usage patterns
```

**2. Pattern Detection (Weekly)**
```
Analyzes 7-day trends:
- Monday-Friday: Higher demand (clinic busy)
- Saturday-Sunday: Lower demand (60% of weekday)
- Moving average calculation for smoothing
```

**3. Seasonal Adjustment (Monthly)**
```
Current Month ‚Üí Check Season ‚Üí Apply Multiplier

Example: August (Typhoon Season)
- Base medication demand: 500 units/week
- Seasonal multiplier: 1.5√ó
- Adjusted forecast: 750 units/week
```

**4. Forecast Projection (Future)**
```
Combines all factors:

Next Week Forecast = 
  (Recent Usage Trend √ó 0.3) + 
  (Previous Forecast √ó 0.7) √ó 
  Seasonal Multiplier √ó 
  Weekly Pattern Adjustment

Confidence Interval:
- High confidence (80-95%): Stable usage, lots of data
- Medium confidence (60-79%): Some variation
- Low confidence (<60%): New medication, limited data
```

---

### Real-World Example: Medication Demand Flow

**Scenario: Rainy Season Starts (June)**

**Week 1 (June 1-7):**
```
1. System detects season change: Dry ‚Üí Wet
2. Seasonal multiplier activates: 1.0√ó ‚Üí 1.5√ó
3. Base medication usage: 400 units
4. Adjusted forecast: 400 √ó 1.5 = 600 units
5. Alert generated: "Increase medication stock by 50%"
```

**Week 2 (June 8-14):**
```
1. Actual usage last week: 580 units
2. Exponential smoothing calculation:
   - New forecast = 0.3 √ó 580 + 0.7 √ó 600
   - New forecast = 174 + 420 = 594 units
3. Seasonal adjustment: 594 √ó 1.5 = 891 units
4. Trend detected: Usage increasing (+45%)
5. Alert updated: "HIGH DEMAND PERIOD - Stock up!"
```

**Week 3 (June 15-21) - Typhoon hits:**
```
1. Disease cases spike (dengue +120%, diarrheal +80%)
2. Emergency appointments increase by 200%
3. Actual usage: 950 units (exceeded forecast)
4. System adapts:
   - New forecast = 0.3 √ó 950 + 0.7 √ó 891
   - New forecast = 285 + 624 = 909 units
5. With seasonal: 909 √ó 1.5 = 1,364 units
6. CRITICAL ALERT: "URGENT: Restock immediately!"
```

**Week 8 (July 20-26) - Season stabilizes:**
```
1. Typhoon season continues but cases plateau
2. Usage stabilizes at 700 units/week
3. Forecast adjusts down gradually:
   - New forecast = 0.3 √ó 700 + 0.7 √ó 909
   - New forecast = 210 + 636 = 846 units
4. With seasonal: 846 √ó 1.5 = 1,269 units
5. Status: "Maintain current stock levels"
```

**Week 20 (December) - Dry season starts:**
```
1. Season changes: Wet ‚Üí Dry
2. Seasonal multiplier: 1.5√ó ‚Üí 1.0√ó
3. Usage drops to 350 units
4. Forecast: 350 √ó 1.0 = 350 units
5. Alert: "Stock levels can be reduced to normal"
```

## üß† Enhanced Forecasting Models

**Location: Admin Dashboard > Enhanced Forecasting Tab**

The system includes advanced forecasting models that work individually or together:

### 1. **Simple Moving Average**
- **What it does**: Averages recent patient visits (3, 7, or 14 days)
- **Best for**: Small datasets (less than 2 weeks of data)
- **Accuracy**: Moderate
- **Example**: If last 7 days had visits of [5, 6, 4, 5, 7, 6, 5], average = 5.4 patients/day

### 2. **Exponential Smoothing**
- **What it does**: Gives more weight to recent data (Œ± = 0.3 factor)
- **Best for**: Medium datasets (2-4 weeks of data)
- **Accuracy**: Good
- **Formula**: `Forecast = 0.3 √ó Recent + 0.7 √ó Previous Forecast`

### 3. **Linear Regression**
- **What it does**: Finds upward/downward trends in patient volume
- **Best for**: Medium datasets with clear trends
- **Accuracy**: Good
- **Example**: If visits increase by 2 patients/week, predicts continued growth

### 4. **Seasonal Decomposition**
- **What it does**: Separates long-term trends from seasonal patterns
- **Best for**: Large datasets (6+ weeks)
- **Accuracy**: Excellent
- **Example**: Identifies that Mondays have 30% more patients than Thursdays

### 5. **Ensemble Model** ‚≠ê
**Location: Enhanced Forecasting Dashboard > Overview Tab**

- **What it does**: Combines ALL models above using weighted averaging
- **How it works**:
  1. Runs all 4 forecasting models independently
  2. Assigns weights based on each model's accuracy (better models get more influence)
  3. Calculates weighted average: `Ensemble = (Model1√óWeight1 + Model2√óWeight2 + ... ) / Total Weights`
- **Best for**: Any scenario with sufficient data
- **Accuracy**: Excellent (highest reliability)
- **Why it's better**: No single model is perfect - combining models reduces individual weaknesses

**Example Ensemble Calculation:**
- Simple MA predicts: 10 patients (weight: 0.2)
- Exponential predicts: 12 patients (weight: 0.3)
- Linear predicts: 11 patients (weight: 0.25)
- Seasonal predicts: 13 patients (weight: 0.25)
- **Ensemble forecast**: (10√ó0.2 + 12√ó0.3 + 11√ó0.25 + 13√ó0.25) / 1.0 = **11.6 patients**

### Weather-Disease Correlation Models

#### 1. **Dengue Forecasting**
- **Weather factors**: High rainfall (mosquito breeding), temperature 25-30¬∞C, humidity >70%
- **Prediction logic**: 
  - Heavy rain (>50mm) ‚Üí High dengue risk in 5-10 days
  - Warm + humid ‚Üí Increases risk by 1.5√ó
- **Medication forecast**: Predicts increased need for fever reducers, IV fluids, platelet boosters

#### 2. **Respiratory Disease Forecasting**
- **Weather factors**: Temperature drops, rainy/cold season, humidity changes
- **Prediction logic**:
  - Temperature <25¬∞C ‚Üí Increased respiratory infections
  - Sudden temperature drops (>5¬∞C) ‚Üí Spike in flu cases
- **Medication forecast**: Anticipates higher demand for cough medicine, antibiotics, antihistamines

#### 3. **Diarrheal Disease Forecasting**
- **Weather factors**: Flooding, heavy rainfall, contaminated water sources
- **Prediction logic**:
  - Flood events ‚Üí Water contamination ‚Üí Diarrheal outbreak in 2-4 days
  - Sustained rain (3+ days) ‚Üí Increased water-borne diseases
- **Medication forecast**: Projects need for ORS (oral rehydration salts), anti-diarrheals, antibiotics

#### 4. **Leptospirosis Forecasting**
- **Weather factors**: Flooding, sustained rainfall, stagnant water
- **Prediction logic**:
  - Flood exposure ‚Üí Leptospirosis risk peaks in 7-14 days
  - Rat population increases during floods
- **Medication forecast**: Prepares doxycycline, penicillin, IV antibiotics

### Wet Season Vaccine Planning
**Special Feature**: Automated vaccine recommendations during typhoon season (June-November)

**Vaccines prioritized:**
1. **Hepatitis A Vaccine** - High priority during floods (water contamination)
2. **Typhoid Vaccine** - High priority (contaminated water transmission)
3. **Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine** - Medium priority (mosquito breeding in stagnant water)
4. **Cholera Vaccine** - Medium priority (waterborne transmission)

**How it works:**
- Monitors 7-day weather forecast
- Detects heavy rainfall periods (>100mm weekly)
- Automatically calculates expected vaccine demand
- Generates restocking recommendations: `Stock Needed = Expected Demand - Current Stock`

**Example:**
- Weather forecast: 150mm rain expected in next 7 days
- Current Hepatitis A stock: 45 doses
- Expected demand (based on historical flood data): 120 doses
- **System recommendation**: "Order 75 additional Hepatitis A vaccines"
