       by Box, Jenkins, Reinsel (5th Edition, 2015)
     - Application: 7-14 day windows for disease surveillance
     - Purpose: Smooths daily fluctuations to identify trends with uncertainty measures
     - Formula: SMA = (x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ) / n
     - NEW: Standard Error = √(Σ(actual - forecast)² / n)
     - NEW: Data Quality Metrics (points, period, error bounds)
     
   • ENHANCED EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING:
     - Method: Single Exponential Smoothing with confidence intervals
     - Reference: "Forecasting: Principles and Practice" by Hyndman & Athanasopoulos (3rd Ed, 2021)
     - Parameter: Alpha = 0.3 (gives 30% weight to most recent observation)
     - Application: Disease case count predictions & resource planning
     - Formula: S₍ₜ₎ = αx₍ₜ₎ + (1-α)S₍ₜ₋₁₎
     - NEW: 68% Confidence Interval = Forecast ± Standard_Error
     - NEW: 95% Confidence Interval = Forecast ± (1.96 × Standard_Error)
     - NEW: Next period forecasting with uncertainty bounds
   
   • ENHANCED SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT:
     - Method: Seasonal decomposition with transparent multipliers
     - Reference: WHO Technical Guidelines for Integrated Disease Surveillance (2019)

     - Method: Multi-factor scoring with transparent steps
     - Formula: Risk_Score = Trend_Points + Seasonal_Points + Disease_Points
     - NEW: Step-by-step calculation display:
       * Step 1: Trend Analysis (0-3 points based on % change)
       * Step 2: Seasonal Factor (0-2 points for typhoon season)
       * Step 3: Disease Virulence (0-1 points based on R₀ value)
     - NEW: Risk Thresholds:
       * Low Risk: 0 points
       * Medium Risk: 1-2 points
       * High Risk: 3-4 points  
       * Critical Risk: 5+ points
     - NEW: Confidence Calculation: 60 + (Data_Points × 2) - (Standard_Error × 10)
     
   • BASIC REPRODUCTION NUMBER (R₀) INTEGRATION:
     - Disease-specific transmissibility factors:

     - NEW: Recommended Order = Total_Need + Safety_Stock
     - NEW: Urgency Assessment:
       * High: Typhoon season active
       * Medium: High volatility detected (Standard_Error > 30% of forecast)
       * Normal: Standard conditions
     
   • TREND ANALYSIS INTEGRATION:
     - NEW: Historical trend detection (increasing/decreasing/stable)
     - Method: Compare recent 3-period vs previous 3-period averages
     - Thresholds: >10% change = trending, ±10% = stable
     - Application: Influences safety stock calculations
     - Context: Climate-sensitive disease modeling for Philippines
   
   • OUTBREAK THRESHOLD DETECTION:
     - Method: Statistical control charts (Cumulative Sum - CUSUM)

    • Risk Levels: Low (0), Medium (1-2), High (3-4), Critical (5+) points

Q5: "How do you calculate resource needs and safety stocks?"
A5: Enhanced exponential smoothing with safety stock integration:
    • Base Forecast: S(t) = α × X(t) + (1-α) × S(t-1) where α = 0.3

Q3: "How accurate is your forecasting system?"
A3: Our mock system shows realistic patterns based on published research. Real 
    accuracy would depend on data quality. Studies show simple statistical 
    methods can achieve 70-85% accuracy for disease outbreak prediction when 
    using quality surveillance data.

   • User-friendly error messages with retry options
   • Loading states prevent user confusion during updates

5. CACHE MANAGEMENT:
   • Frontend cache cleared on each 30-minute refresh
   • Backend generates fresh data for each API request
   • No stale data persistence - always current calculations
   • Timestamp tracking for data freshness validation

6. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
   • Efficient statistical algorithms for real-time calculation
   • Minimal data transfer with focused API responses
   • Component-level state management for smooth updates
   • Background refresh prevents UI blocking

PRODUCTION DATABASE INTEGRATION EXAMPLE:
```javascript
// Replace mock functions with real database queries
async function getRealDiseaseData(diseaseType, days) {
  const query = `
    SELECT DATE(createdAt) as date, COUNT(*) as value 
    FROM medical_records 
    WHERE diagnosis LIKE '%${diseaseType}%' 
    AND createdAt >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL ${days} DAY)
    GROUP BY DATE(createdAt)
    ORDER BY date
  `;
  return await sequelize.query(query);
}

async function getRealResourceData(resourceType, days) {
  const query = `
    SELECT DATE(usageDate) as date, SUM(quantity) as value
    FROM inventory_usage 
    WHERE resourceType = '${resourceType}'
    AND usageDate >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL ${days} DAY)
    GROUP BY DATE(usageDate)
    ORDER BY date
  `;
  return await sequelize.query(query);
}
```

USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------------

DAILY MONITORING:
• Check dashboard for current risk levels
• Review disease trend indicators
• Monitor resource capacity alerts

WEEKLY PLANNING:
• Analyze 7-day forecasts for staffing
• Review supply needs projections
• Plan for seasonal preparations

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS:
• Monitor typhoon season escalation
• Prepare surge capacity plans
• Coordinate with local health units

SEASONAL PLANNING:
• Pre-position resources before typhoon season
• Scale up surveillance during high-risk periods
• Plan staff rotations for peak seasons
