# ✅ Hotfix Complete: Patient Login After Email/Phone Update

## 🐛 Problem Fixed

**Issue:** When patients updated their email or phone number, they couldn't log in with the new credentials anymore.

**Root Cause:** The `User.username` field (used for login) wasn't being updated when email/phone changed.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

**File Modified:** `backend/routes/patients.js` (lines 531-558)

**What Changed:**
- Now updates `User.username` field when email or phone is updated
- Also updates `User.contactNumber` field (not just email)
- Prioritizes email over phone for username
- Properly handles "N/A" values

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

```javascript
// Before Update
User: { username: "old@email.com", email: "old@email.com" }

// After Email Update
User: { username: "new@email.com", email: "new@email.com" } ✅

// Login with "new@email.com" → SUCCESS! ✅
```

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

1. Login as a patient
2. Update your email in Profile Settings
3. Logout
4. Login with the NEW email
5. ✅ Should work immediately!

## 📍 Key Changes

### OLD CODE
```javascript
// Only updated email
if (email !== undefined) {
  await user.update({ email: email });
}
```

### NEW CODE
```javascript
// Updates email, phone, AND username
if (email !== undefined || contactNumber !== undefined) {
  const userUpdateData = {};
  if (email !== undefined) {
    userUpdateData.email = cleanEmail;
  }
  if (contactNumber !== undefined) {
    userUpdateData.contactNumber = cleanPhone;
  }
  // UPDATE USERNAME TOO!
  userUpdateData.username = cleanEmail || cleanPhone || existingValue;
  await user.update(userUpdateData);
}
```
