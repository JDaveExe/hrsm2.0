# Weather API Testing - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Immediate Testing (No API Keys Required)

The weather system has been designed with intelligent fallbacks. For immediate testing:

1. **Mock Data Fallback**: When all APIs fail, the system uses realistic mock data
2. **Healthcare Integration**: Weather-based health recommendations still work
3. **7-Day Forecast**: Complete forecast display with Philippine weather patterns

## 🌤️ Setting Up Real Weather APIs

3. Get your API key
4. Create `.env` file in project root:
   ```
   REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

### Option 2: OpenWeatherMap
