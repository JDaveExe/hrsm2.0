# Password Reset Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added password reset functionality to:
1. **Patient Dashboard** > My Profile > Edit Information
2. **Admin Dashboard** > Patient Management > Edit Patient Info

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes (`src/components/patient/components/PatientProfile.js`)

#### 1. Added State Management
```javascript
// Password change state
const [isChangingPassword, setIsChangingPassword] = useState(false);
const [passwordData, setPasswordData] = useState({
  newPassword: '',
  confirmPassword: ''
});
```

#### 2. New Password Rendering Function
- `renderPasswordField()` - Handles password field display
  - **View Mode**: Shows asterisks (â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢)
  - **Edit Mode**: Shows password input field
  - **Conditional Confirm Field**: Only shows "Confirm Password" field when user starts typing new password

#### 3. Password Validation in `handleSaveChanges()`
- Validates both password fields are filled
- Checks if passwords match
- Ensures minimum 6 characters
- Adds password to form data only if changing

#### 4. UI Layout
- Password field placed beside Phone Number in Contact Information section
- Confirm Password field appears dynamically below the password field
- Clean, intuitive interface with placeholder text

### Backend Changes (`backend/routes/patients.js`)

#### 1. Added Password Parameter
- Added `password` to destructured request body variables

#### 2. Enhanced User Update Logic
- Updated condition: `if (email !== undefined || contactNumber !== undefined || password !== undefined)`
- Password handling:
  ```javascript
  if (password !== undefined && password !== '' && password !== null) {
    userUpdateData.password = password;
  }
  ```
- Password is hashed automatically by the `beforeUpdate` hook in User model

### Admin Side Changes (`src/components/admin/components/PatientManagement.js`)

#### 1. Added Password State Management
```javascript
const [isChangingPatientPassword, setIsChangingPatientPassword] = useState(false);
const [patientPasswordData, setPatientPasswordData] = useState({
  newPassword: '',
  confirmPassword: ''
});
```

#### 2. Updated handleEditPatient
- Resets password state when opening edit modal
- Ensures clean slate for each edit operation

#### 3. Enhanced handleSaveEditPatient
- Validates password fields if admin is changing password
- Checks password match and minimum length
- Adds password to update data only if changing
- Shows success message indicating password was changed

#### 4. UI Implementation
- Password field in Contact Information section (3-column layout)
- Confirm password field appears dynamically when typing
- Same user experience as patient-side implementation

### Password Hashing
- No manual hashing in route - relies on Sequelize `beforeUpdate` hook
- Hook only rehashes if password field is detected as changed
- Prevents double-hashing issue discovered earlier

## Features

### Security Features
1. **Password Masking**: Display shows asterisks instead of actual password
2. **Confirmation Required**: Must enter password twice when changing
3. **Minimum Length**: Enforces 6-character minimum
4. **Hash Protection**: Automatic bcrypt hashing via model hook
5. **Optional Change**: Can edit other fields without changing password

### User Experience
1. **Smart UI**: Confirm field only appears when password is being modified
2. **Clear Feedback**: Error messages for validation failures
3. **Success Notification**: Alert confirms password change
4. **Non-Intrusive**: Password field present but doesn't require attention unless needed

## Testing

### Test Script 1: `test-password-reset.js` (Patient Self-Service)

**Test Flow:**
1. Register new patient with original password
2. Login with original password (verify it works)
3. Update password via patient profile endpoint
4. Try login with OLD password (should fail)
5. Login with NEW password via email (should succeed)
6. Login with NEW password via phone (should succeed)
7. Clean up test data

**Run Test:**
```bash
node test-password-reset.js
```

### Test Script 2: `test-admin-password-reset.js` (Admin Password Reset)

**Test Flow:**
1. Login as admin
2. Create test patient with original password
3. Patient logs in with original password (verify it works)
4. Admin resets patient's password via admin endpoint
5. Patient tries OLD password (should fail)
6. Patient logs in with NEW password set by admin (should succeed)
7. Patient logs in with phone + NEW password (should succeed)
8. Clean up test data

**Run Test:**
```bash
node test-admin-password-reset.js
```

**Expected Output (Both Tests):**
```
âœ… All steps: PASS

ðŸŽ‰ SUCCESS! Password reset is working perfectly!
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Patients (Self-Service):
1. Go to **My Profile** in the Patient Dashboard
2. Click **Edit Information** button
3. Scroll to Contact Information section
4. To change password:
   - Type new password in the **Password** field
   - A **Confirm Password** field will appear automatically
   - Enter the same password in the confirmation field
5. Click **Save Changes**
6. Success message confirms password has been changed
7. Next login, use the new password

### For Admins (Reset Patient Password):
1. Go to **Patient Management** in Admin Dashboard
2. Select a patient from the list
3. Click **Edit Patient Info** button
4. Scroll to Contact Information section (3rd column)
5. To reset patient's password:
   - Type new password in the **Password** field
   - A **Confirm Password** field will appear automatically
   - Enter the same password in the confirmation field
6. Update other fields as needed (or leave them unchanged)
7. Click **Save Changes**
8. Success message confirms patient password has been changed
9. Inform the patient of their new password

### Important Notes:
- Password field is optional - can update other info without changing password
- Leave password blank to keep current password
- Must enter password twice (new + confirm) to change it
- Minimum 6 characters required
- Old password becomes invalid immediately after change
- Can login with email or phone number after password change

## Integration with Existing Features

### Works With:
- âœ… Credential update fix (email/phone changes)
- âœ… Login with email
- âœ… Login with phone number
- âœ… JWT authentication
- âœ… Sequelize password hashing hooks
- âœ… Audit trail system (if enabled)

### No Conflicts:
- Password change doesn't affect other profile fields
- Username updates correctly when email changes
- Login works with both email and phone after password reset
- No double-hashing issues

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Not Stored in Plain Text**: Hashed with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
2. **Password Not Logged**: Not included in backend console logs
3. **Old Password Invalidated**: Previous password stops working immediately
4. **No Password in Response**: Password never returned in API responses
5. **Token-Based Update**: Requires valid JWT to change password
6. **Validation**: Both frontend and backend validate password requirements

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add "Current Password" field for additional security
- Add password strength indicator
- Add password requirements tooltip
- Email notification when password is changed
- Password history (prevent reusing recent passwords)
- Rate limiting on password change attempts
